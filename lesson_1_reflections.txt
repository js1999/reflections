How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Because I could limit the output to only
lines that were changes, it was much easier
to spot differences between the two files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can see what changes I made and what I did wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
You need to remember when to commit but it's good because you can choose.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It's much more complex to track changes accross multiple files. But it's very good for developers.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log shows you all commits ever. diff lets you compare two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because you can always revert!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Version control!!!
